- **Features of java**

    1. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in java is considered as an object,
       The OOPs concepts are followed as well,
        1. **Object**: An `entity` that has `state, behavior and identity`, is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible).
        2. **Class**: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a `template or blueprint` from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
        **It contains**: `Fields, Methods, Constructors, Blocks, Nested Class and interfaces`
        3. **Inheritance**: It is a `mechanism` one object acquires all the features of the parent object, It represents the `IS-A relationship` which is nothing but a simple parent-child relationship,
        
           _Why?_: For the case of `method overriding during runtime` and also for `maximum reusable code`
           
           Types of Inheritance: `Single, Multi-level, Hierarchial, Multiple(not supported in java)`
 
           Aggregation:If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents `HAS-A relationship`
           
         4. **Abstraction**  : It is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user,
            
            There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
            
            1. Abstract class (0 to 100%)
            2. Interface (100%)
